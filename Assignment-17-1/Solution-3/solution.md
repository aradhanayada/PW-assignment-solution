## Primitive Data Types in JavaScript
### String:
Represents text and is enclosed in single (' ') or double (" ") quotes.

**Example:**
     
       let myString = "Hello, World!";
    
## Number:
Represents numeric data, including integers and floating-point numbers.

**Example:**
   
     let myNumber = 42;
## Boolean:
Represents a binary value of true or false.
Used for logical operations and conditions.

**Example:**
  
   let isTrue = true;
## Undefined:
Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

**Example:**
   
   let myUndefinedVariable;
## Null:
Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
Often used to assign an empty or non-existent value.

**Example:**
 
    let myNullVariable = null;
These primitive data types are the building blocks of JavaScript and are used to store simple values in variables. They are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. Understanding these data types is fundamental for working with JavaScript variables and data manipulation.
