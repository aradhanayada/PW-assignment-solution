## Purpose of Declaring Variables in JavaScript
In JavaScript, variables are used to store and manage data during the execution of a program. They provide a way to reference and manipulate values, making code more flexible and dynamic. Declaring variables allows developers to:

**Store Data:** Variables hold values of different types, such as numbers, strings, or objects, enabling the storage of diverse information.

**Manipulate Data:** Variables can be updated and modified, allowing for dynamic changes to the data within a program.

**Facilitate Readability:** Named variables improve code readability and maintainability by providing meaningful identifiers for data.

### Declaring Variables Using the let Keyword
In JavaScript, variables are declared using the let keyword. The basic syntax is as follows:

    let variableName = initialValue;
**let:** Keyword used for variable declaration.
**variableName:** Name given to the variable. It must follow naming rules and conventions.
**initialValue:** Optional initial value assigned to the variable. If not provided, the variable is initialized with the value undefined.

#### Examples:

     let age = 25;           // Declaration with an initial value
     let name;               // Declaration without an initial value (initialized to undefined)

      // Variables can be updated with new values
       name = "John";
      age = age + 1;

      // Variables can store different types of data
        let message = "Hello, World!";
       let isStudent = true;
Using the let keyword ensures that the variable is block-scoped, meaning its scope is limited to the block, statement, or expression where it is defined. This helps prevent unintended side effects and enhances code maintainability.

In summary, declaring variables in JavaScript with the let keyword serves the purpose of managing, manipulating, and storing data within a program, contributing to code flexibility and readability.
