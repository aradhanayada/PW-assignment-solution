## Operators in JavaScript

Operators in JavaScript are symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They play a crucial role in programming by allowing developers to manipulate data, perform calculations, and make decisions. Here are some essential types of operators in JavaScript:

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators:**
   - Used for mathematical calculations.
   - Example: `+, -, *, /, %` (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus).

   ```javascript
   let result = 10 + 5; // result is 15
```

### 2. Assignment Operators:

- Assign values to variables.
- Example: =, +=, -=, *=, /= (assignment, addition assignment, subtraction assignment, multiplication assignment, division assignment).

```javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5; // x is now 15
```

### 3. Comparison Operators:

- Compare values and return a boolean result.
- Example: ==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <= (equal, strict equal, not equal, strict not equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal, less than or equal).

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 5;
console.log(a > b); // true
```

### 4. Logical Operators:
- Combine multiple boolean values and return a boolean result.
- Example: &&, ||, ! (logical AND, logical OR, logical NOT).
```javascript
let condition1 = true;
let condition2 = false;
console.log(condition1 && condition2); // false```
```
### 5. Unary Operators:
- Operate on a single operand.
- Example: ++, -- (increment, decrement).
```javascript
let counter = 5;
counter++; // counter is now 6
```
### 6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
- Provides a shorthand way of writing an if-else statement.
- Example: condition ? expr1 : expr2.
```javascript
let age = 20;
let status = (age >= 18) ? 'Adult' : 'Minor';
```
Operators are essential in programming as they enable the creation of complex algorithms, facilitate data manipulation, and help in decision-making processes.
