# Solution
## Operator Precedence and Associativity in JavaScript
### Precedence:
- Definition: Precedence determines the order in which operators are evaluated in an expression.
Example:
```javascript
let result = 5 + 10 * 2; // Multiplication has higher precedence than addition
```
### Associativity:
- Definition: Associativity defines the order in which operators of the same precedence are evaluated.
Example:
```javascript
let result = 20 / 4 / 2; // Division is left-associative, so it's evaluated from left to right
```
#### Importance:
- Why it's Important:
Understanding precedence and associativity helps in predicting the order of operations in complex expressions.
 - It ensures that expressions are evaluated as intended, preventing unexpected results.
Parentheses can be used to override the default precedence and explicitly define the evaluation order.
#### In Summary:

Precedence and associativity are crucial for writing accurate and predictable code. They guide how expressions are parsed and evaluated, impacting the outcome of mathematical and logical operations. Awareness of these concepts is essential for maintaining code clarity and correctness.
