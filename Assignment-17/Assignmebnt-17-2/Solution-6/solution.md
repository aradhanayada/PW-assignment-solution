# Importance of Meaningful Variable Names in JavaScript

Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is crucial for improving code readability and maintainability. Clear identifiers make it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the purpose and functionality of variables within the code.

## Example:

Consider the following code with poorly named variables:

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 8;

// Function to calculate the sum of two numbers
function calcSum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

let result = calcSum(x, y);
```

In this example, it's not immediately clear what x and y represent, and the function calcSum provides limited context. Now, let's use meaningful names:

```javascript
let firstNumber = 5;
let secondNumber = 8;

function calculateSum(num1, num2) {
  return num1 + num2;
}

let sumResult = calculateSum(firstNumber, secondNumber);
```
By choosing more descriptive names like firstNumber, secondNumber, calculateSum, and sumResult, the code becomes self-explanatory. Anyone reading the code can easily understand the purpose of each variable and function, leading to improved code comprehension and maintainability.
