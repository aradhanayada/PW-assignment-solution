### Comma Operator in JavaScript

The comma operator in JavaScript allows you to evaluate multiple expressions in a single statement. It is often used in situations where multiple expressions need to be executed, and only the result of the last expression is returned. The syntax of the comma operator is as follows:

expression1, expression2, expression3, ..., expressionN;

The expressions are evaluated from left to right.
The value of the entire expression is the value of the last expression.
**Example:**

    let x = 5, y = 10;

     // Using comma operator in a for loop
      for (let i = 0, j = 0; i < 5; i++, j += 2) {
       console.log(`i: ${i}, j: ${j}`);
      }

      // Using comma operator to assign multiple variables
       let a = (x++, y++);
       console.log(`a: ${a}, x: ${x}, y: ${y}`);
In the first example, the comma operator is used in a for loop to initialize and increment multiple variables. In the second example, the comma operator is used to increment x and y and assign the result to a. The output will demonstrate the values of the variables after these operations.
