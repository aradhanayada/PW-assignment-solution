        understand content.

      -  Native support for audio and video elements **`<audio>`** and **`<video>`** allows embedding audio and video content directly in web 
         pages without the need for third-party plugins.
 - **`Form Enhancements:`**
      -  New input types `(<input type="email">, <input type="url">, <input type="date">, etc.)` and attributes (required, placeholder, pattern) 
         enhance web form functionality and validation.

      - The localStorage and sessionStorage APIs enable persistent client-side storage, reducing the need for cookies for certain data storage 
       tasks.
 - **`Cross-Browser Compatibility:`**
      - HTML5 was designed to work consistently across different browsers and platforms, reducing the need for browser-specific code.
 - **`Geolocation:`**
      - The Geolocation API allows web applications to access a user's geographical location, enabling location-based services.
