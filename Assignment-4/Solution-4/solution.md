### Three Ways to Improve HTML5 Accessibility

1. **Use Semantic HTML Elements**:
   - Employ semantic HTML5 elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` to provide a clear and meaningful structure to your web page content.
   - Use appropriate heading levels (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) to create a hierarchical structure that aids screen readers and users in understanding the content's organization.

2. **Provide Alternative Text for Images**:
   - Always include descriptive alt text for images using the `alt` attribute within the `<img>` element.
   - Alt text should convey the purpose and content of the image, making it accessible to users who cannot see the visual content, including those using screen readers.

3. **Implement Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Ensure that all interactive elements, such as links, buttons, and form fields, can be accessed and used with a keyboard.
   - Test and improve keyboard navigation to ensure that users can navigate through your web page, activate links and buttons, and complete forms without relying on a mouse.

By implementing these practices, you can significantly enhance the accessibility of your HTML5 web content, making it more usable and inclusive for all users, including those with disabilities.
