## SEO
SEO (Search Engine Optimization) helps in increasing the online visibility of a website in the organic (that means unpaid!) results of a search engine. In modern times, SEO is extremely important as it helps the website grow by optimizing the website content and the keywords. In fact, it wouldn’t be too far fetched to say that a business requires SEO for their website in order to achieve optimum results.
## SEO IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE
#### SEO Increases Organic Search Web Traffic
it is the Google search results that are not from paid ads. Organic search constitutes a major part of the performance of a website and it plays a big part in getting customers to complete conversion in the website. This means that if you want your website to work (And I’m sure you do!!!) SEO is vital as it is a major source of Organic Search Traffic.
####  Good Website SEO Leads to a Better User Experience
 user experience can be obtained by having a user-friendly and clean design, various photos and videos interspersed with the content, etc. All these are also a part of SEO and if a website employs optimal SEO, then it can easily improve their user experience. (You see why SEO is so important?!)
#### SEO Results in more Sales 
Local businesses want local sales (Obviously!). And so, it is very important for them that their websites are search engine optimized. This leads to increased online traffic and also a direct increase in sales for them(And who doesn’t want that?!). This correlation between SEO and increased sales exists because most customers prefer to locally search businesses online to find out details about their location, directions, etc.
#### Website Credibility Increases With SEO
SEO results in higher ranks on search engine results which directly increases the credibility of the website as well as the business. If the website is ranked lower on the second or third page, it may lead to losses as it is assumed that the business is new or that they have a low financial position. (Refer to the beginning quote!)
#### SEO is Quantifiable
SEO is quantifiable (That means measurable in case you were wondering!) and the performance and growth of a website after optimization can be easily measured using various methods. Growth in website traffic, improvements in search engine results page rankings, increase in conversions and revenue, etc. can be used to quantify the success of SEO for a website.
#### SEO Makes Ads More Effective
The ads seen on websites and they can be quite jarring!!! However, these ads are used to make users visit the website (even if they have the opposite effect sometimes!). This can be streamlined by SEO wherein the users smoothly continue their journey on the website after the ad click to eventual conversions and not abandon the website because of a non-optimized design.
#### SEO Requires Comparatively Less Constant Engagement
There are many other inbound techniques such as social media, blogging, etc. that require more engagement as compared to SEO (Feeding the social media beast as they call it!). This is because in social media or blogging, constant monitoring of market trends, customer choices, etc. is required and constant updating of new posts is also needed. This constant engagement is comparatively less in SEO as after optimizing a page, only some supervision is needed
#### SEO Benefits Outweigh Its Costs
While SEO does cost money, it is definitely better to have an optimized website. An optimized website is user-friendly and leads to more interactive traffic. It is also more concise and as fast as possible. This means that the benefits of SEO far outweigh its costs (So you won’t regret it!).
#### SEO leads to increased conversions
SEO leads to an increase in traffic that also leads to increased conversions and optimizes the conversion rate. This can be done by making sure that the optimized website design subtly and seamlessly guides the users to take the required action such as getting a subscription to the newsletter, buying a product, setting an appointment, etc.
#### Mobile SEO Aligns With the Online Activities of Users
Mobile SEO is very important in current times as over 60% of the users engage in mobile online activities (As we all know from personal experience!). This means that if a website is only optimized for a desktop, it is not enough. So, mobile SEO provides seamless integration of the mobile experience with the physical experience as many users search for businesses online to find out details about them before physically visiting them.
