        <h1>The Earth !!!</h1>
        <p>
          Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical
          object known to harbor life. This is enabled by Earth being a water
          world, the only one in the Solar System sustaining liquid surface
          water. Almost all of Earth's water is contained in its global ocean,
          covering 70.8% of Earth's surface. The remaining 29.2% of Earth's
          surface is land, most of which is located in the form of continental
          landmasses within one hemisphere, Earth's land hemisphere. Most of
          Earth's land is somewhat humid and covered by vegetation, while large
          sheets of ice at Earth's polar deserts retain more water than Earth's
          groundwater, lakes, rivers and atmospheric water combined. Earth's
          land is part of Earth's crust, consisting of several slowly moving
          tectonic plates, which interact to produce mountain ranges, volcanoes,
          and earthquakes. Earth has a liquid outer core that generates a
          magnetosphere capable of deflecting most of the destructive solar
          winds and cosmic radiation.The third planet from the sun, Earth is the
          only place in the known universe confirmed to host life. With a radius
          of 3,959 miles, Earth is the fifth largest planet in our solar system,
          and it's the only one known for sure to have liquid water on its
          surface. Earth is also unique in terms of monikers.
