### Key Properties in the Flexbox Layout Model

1. **`justify-content`**

   - **Usage:** This property defines how flex items are horizontally aligned within their container along the main axis.
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container (left in a horizontal layout).
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container (right in a horizontal layout).
     - `center`: Items are centered along the main axis.
     - `space-between`: Items are evenly distributed with the first item at the start and the last item at the end.
     - `space-around`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space around them.
     - `space-evenly`: Items are evenly distributed with equal space between them.

2. **`align-items`**

   - **Usage:** This property defines how flex items are vertically aligned within their container along the cross axis.
   - **Values:**
     - `flex-start`: Items are aligned to the start of the container (top in a vertical layout).
     - `flex-end`: Items are aligned to the end of the container (bottom in a vertical layout).
     - `center`: Items are centered along the cross axis.
     - `baseline`: Items are aligned based on their baselines.
     - `stretch`: Items are stretched to fill the container.

3. **`gap`**

   - **Usage:** This property specifies the gap or spacing between flex items within a flex container.
   - **Values:** You can provide a length or percentage value to define the gap between items.

4. **`flex-direction`**

   - **Usage:** This property defines the direction of the main axis in the flex container, determining how flex items are laid out.
   - **Values:**
     - `row`: Main axis is horizontal, and items are laid out from left to right.
     - `row-reverse`: Main axis is horizontal, but items are laid out from right to left.
     - `column`: Main axis is vertical, and items are laid out from top to bottom.
     - `column-reverse`: Main axis is vertical, but items are laid out from bottom to top.

5. **`flex-wrap`**

   - **Usage:** This property determines whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they don't fit within the container.
   - **Values:**
     - `nowrap`: Items are not allowed to wrap; they will shrink to fit within the container.
     - `wrap`: Items wrap onto multiple lines as needed to fit.
     - `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap onto multiple lines in the reverse order.

These properties are essential for creating flexible and responsive layouts using the Flexbox layout model. They control alignment, direction, spacing, and wrapping behavior of flex items within a flex container.
