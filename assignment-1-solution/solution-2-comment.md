### Solution:
### Purpose of comments in HTML:
- The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code.
-  Comments are not displayed in the browsers. 
- We can use comments to explain our code, 
- It can help us when you edit the source code at a later date. 
- An HTML comment begins with <! –– and the comment closes with––>
- Types of comments are:
    - **Single-line comment:**  Single line comment is given inside the ( <!–  comment –> ) tag.
    - **Multi-line comment:** Multiple lines can be given by the syntax (<!– –>), Basically it’s the same as we used in single line comment, difference is half part of the comment (” –> “), is appended where the intended comment line ends. 
    - **Using <comment> tag**: There used to be an HTML <comment> tag, but currently it is not supported by any modern browser.
### Example of comments : 
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <body>
        <!--This is single line comment,It wont be displayed by the browser -->
        <h2>This is single line comment</h2>
         <!-- This is
         multi-line
         comment -->
         <h2>This is multi-line comment</h2>
         </comment>
         <h2>This is a comment using</h2>
         </body>
         </html>
