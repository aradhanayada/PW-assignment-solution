### Solution
#### DOCTYPE declaration in HTML
- All HTML documents must start with a <!DOCTYPE>
- The declaration is not an HTML tag.
- It is an "information" to the browser about what document type to expect.
- In HTML5, the <!DOCTYPE> declaration is simple

      <!DOCTYPE html>
- In older documents (HTML 4 or XHTML), the declaration is more complicated because the declaration must refer to a DTD (Document Type Definition).

      <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN""http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
